To build the project, simply run make. Requires antlr to be in the classpath.
To run the compiler, run 'java Compile <args> <source>'.
The available optimization options are:
   -copy: Copy propogation
   -useless: Useless code removal
   -const: Constant folding and propogation

Additionally, the debug flag -dumpIL will cause the ILOC to be printed to the screen.
For convienience, the compile.sh script can be run from any directory and will compile the
given source with all optimizations. It should be run as 'bash compile.sh <source>' where 
source is the name of the source file without the .mini extension.
